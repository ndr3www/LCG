## ðŸŽ² About
A linear congruential generator is a simple RNG that produces a sequence of psuedorandom numbers using a discontinuous piecewise linear equation. The algorithm is well known for it's high performance and ease of use.  
This particular implementation requires support for the latest C23 standard since it uses a variable integer widths `_BitInt()`.
